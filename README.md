# unleash-client-go
Unleash Client for Go.  Read more about the [Unleash project](https://github.com/seatgeek/unleash)

**Version 3.x of the client requires `unleash-server` v3.x or higher.**

## Go Version

The client is currently tested against Go 1.10.x and 1.13.x. These versions will be updated
as new versions of Go are released.

The client may work on older versions of Go as well, but are not actively tested.

## Getting started

### 1. Install unleash-client-go

To install the latest version of the client use:

```bash
go get github.com/seatgeek/unleash-client-go/v3
```

If you are still using Unleash Server v2.x.x, then you should use:

```bash
go get github.com/seatgeek/unleash-client-go
```

### 2. Initialize unleash

The easiest way to get started with Unleash is to initialize it early in your application code:

```go
import (
	"github.com/seatgeek/unleash-client-go/v3"
)

func init() {
	unleash.Initialize(
		unleash.WithListener(&unleash.DebugListener{}),
		unleash.WithAppName("my-application"),
		unleash.WithUrl("http://unleash.herokuapp.com/api/"),
	)
}
```

### 3. Use unleash

After you have initialized the unleash-client you can easily check if a feature
toggle is enabled or not.

```go
unleash.IsEnabled("app.ToggleX")
```

### 4. Stop unleash

To shut down the client (turn off the polling) you can simply call the
destroy-method. This is typically not required.

unleash.Close()

### Built in activation strategies
The Go client comes with implementations for the built-in activation strategies
provided by unleash.

- DefaultStrategy
- UserIdStrategy
- GradualRolloutUserIdStrategy
- GradualRolloutSessionIdStrategy
- GradualRolloutRandomStrategy
- RemoteAddressStrategy
- ApplicationHostnameStrategy

Read more about the strategies in [activation-strategy.md](https://github.com/seatgeek/unleash/blob/master/docs/activation-strategies.md).

### Unleash context

In order to use some of the common activation strategies you must provide a
[unleash-context](https://github.com/seatgeek/unleash/blob/master/docs/unleash-context.md).
This client SDK allows you to send in the unleash context as part of the `isEnabled` call:

```go
ctx := context.Context{
    UserId: "123",
    SessionId: "some-session-id",
    RemoteAddress: "127.0.0.1",
}

unleash.IsEnabled("someToggle", unleash.WithContext(ctx))
```

### Caveat
This client uses go routines to report several events and doesn't drain the channel by default. So you need to either register a listener using `WithListener` or drain the channel "manually" (demonstrated in [this example](https://github.com/seatgeek/unleash-client-go/blob/master/example_with_instance_test.go)).
